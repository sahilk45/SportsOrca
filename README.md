# Premier League Fixtures App

A modern React application that displays Premier League fixtures using the football-data.org API with robust error handling and CORS bypass solutions.

## 🚀 Current Status (May 30, 2025)

- ✅ **API Integration**: Successfully connected to football-data.org
- ⚠️ **Live Data**: Not available (off-season period)
- 🔄 **Demo Mode**: Currently active with realistic fixtures
- 📅 **Next Update**: June 18, 2025 (fixture release date)

## ⚽ Why Demo Data?

The Premier League 2024/25 season concluded on **May 25, 2025**. New fixtures for the 2025/26 season will be released on **June 18, 2025**, with the season starting **August 16, 2025**.

This is completely normal and expected behavior for football fixture apps during off-season periods.

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### CORS Solution Implemented
- **Primary**: CORS proxy using `api.allorigins.win`
- **Fallback**: Direct API calls when possible
- **Alternative**: Vite proxy configuration (see vite.config.js)

### Error Handling
- Graceful API failure handling
- Automatic fallback to demo data
- Clear status communication to users
- Detailed console logging for developers

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Loading states and animations
- Team crests and match details
- Status banners with clear communication
- Professional error states

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd premier-league-fixtures
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
# Create .env file
VITE_API_URL=https://api.football-data.org/v4
VITE_API_KEY=b647611067174988974bb40a4a864f6a
```

3. **Start development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 API Integration Details

### Endpoint Used
- **URL**: `https://api.football-data.org/v4/competitions/PL/matches`
- **Method**: GET
- **Headers**: `X-Auth-Token: {API_KEY}`
- **Filters**: `?status=SCHEDULED&limit=10`

### CORS Bypass Methods

**Method 1: CORS Proxy (Currently Active)**
```javascript
const CORS_PROXY = 'https://api.allorigins.win/get?url=';
const proxyUrl = `${CORS_PROXY}${encodeURIComponent(API_URL)}`;
```

**Method 2: Vite Proxy (Alternative)**
```javascript
// vite.config.js proxy configuration
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'https://api.football-data.org',
    changeOrigin: true,
    // ... configuration
  }
}
```

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **API Check**: Attempts to fetch live fixtures
2. **CORS Handling**: Uses proxy if direct call fails
3. **Data Validation**: Checks for upcoming matches
4. **Fallback Logic**: Switches to demo data if no live fixtures
5. **UI Update**: Displays appropriate status and fixtures

## 🎯 For Mentors/Reviewers
